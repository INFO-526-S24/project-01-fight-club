    "text": "Why did you choose this data-set?\n\nThere are several reasons why we chose this data-set. The first reason is that the data is well-formatted and is rich in variables, making it interesting for data wrangling and visualizing patterns.\nThe second reason is the social media engagement and interest in this particular phenomenon.\nLastly, UFO sightings hold a plethora of significance in scientific research, as humans have been wondering and searching for life outside Earth ever since the first telescope was discovered. In summary, it would be interesting to engage in discussions of mysteries of the cosmos and extraterrestrial life while also contributing to the cause with our visualizations."

    "text": "Data Pre-processing\nWe would need to do some data cleaning and pre-processing to improve the validity of the visualizations.\nufo_sightings.csv:\n\nUse places where the UFO sightings are more than 200.\nGroup NA, “unknown” and “other” values in the shape column under a single heading.\nInclude only those observations where the duration of UFO sightings are more 5 minutes.\n\nplaces.csv:\n\nRemove the negative values from elevation column.\n\n\nDiscuss potential biases.\n\nIt is entirely possible that people in smaller cities with lesser knowledge of modern technology may have seen a plane or helicopter in the sky, and mistook it for a UFO. But at the same time, it is possible that they have seen a UFO and didn’t have the proper methods to report such a sighting.\nOn the other hand, people in larger cities may not be able to clearly view these supposed “UFO sightings” due to air pollution and sky-scrapers being more prevalent in these areas. But contrary to people in smaller cities, they may have the means to report the sightings quickly.\nWe believe that although this would introduce bad data in the data-set, there isn’t a suitable solution to address this issue. But the shapes column in the ufo_sightings data-set can be a good way to filter out the data-sets, regardless of the location of the sightings.\nShapes that are more commonly sighted will be more likely to actually be true, versus shapes that have one-off or just a few sightings.\nFor example, the “cube” shape has only been sighted twice, which is improbable that it may be sighted correctly, because otherwise we would have seen more sightings of that shape in our data-set. On the other hand, the circle shape appears to be very likely as it has been sighted over 9000 times.\nFurthermore, in order to establish a correlation between UFO shapes and locations, we plan to run a chi-squared test that can quantify the strength and significance of these relationships."

Is there any correlation between the location of the sighting and the shape of the UFO?\n\nAt the beginning of the project, we will start off by cleaning and wrangling the data. All the data that might not be necessary for our workflow will be removed. We will also be adding and modifying data to the datasets that we have received from the TidyTuesday.\nOur first step with tackling the first question is to use the cleaned data to plot a heatmap of the world.\nWe will group the data of the countries to find the number of sightings in each of the countries.\nThen, we will use the ggmap package of R to plot a heatmap of the world with this data.\nFrom there, we will work on zoning in on the United States. Figuring out those cities where these sightings are prevalent. This will be done using ggplot’s geom_point feature, and the longitude and latitude columns. We will paste this plot over a realistic map of the United States, marking the cities where the density of the sightings are more prevalent.\nThen, we will visualize whether certain areas are more likely to report a certain shape. This will be done with a histogram, comparing the densities of the shapes for the states.\n\nQ.2) Are there any patterns to the sightings concerning seasons? Do astronomical events affect the reported sightings?\n\nFirst, we will slice the reported_date_time_utc column in the ufo_sightingsdataset, and separate the dates and times from it.\nThen we will clean data to handle all the various time zones and merge them accurately, which we have explained below.\nAlongside this, we will work on grouping the dates, by their seasons (i.e. spring, summer, fall, winter)\nUsing this data, we will plot a line chart to visualize the time series analysis of the seasonal data.\nFor the plot to visualize whether astronomical events affect the sightings, we are going to be using a sunburst plot, which will be a part of the sunburstR package.\n\nParameters used\n\nufo_sightings\n\nreported_date_time_utc\ncity\nstate\ncountry_code\nshape\n\nplaces\n\nlatitude\nlongitude\npopulation\nelevation\nstate\ntimezone\n\nday_parts_map\n\nAll columns other than rounded_lat and rounded_long"

Explore the structure and contents of each CSV file and identify any potential issues or inconsistencies in the data.\nData Pre-processing - Cleaning of ufo_sightings.csv and places.csv data-set Filtering out observations and remove NA values from the shape and day_part columns.\nTime Zone Alignment- Develop a methodology for aligning sighting times with sunrise and sunset data. Executing the alignment procedure, making sure that time zone modifications are made accurately. Cross-reference the alignment with the times of known sunrise and sunset for particular areas to confirm it.\n\nWeek-2\n\nGeographic Distribution Analysis - Plot sightings on a map using ggplot2. The cleaned data-sets will be used to visualize the geographic distribution of UFO sightings. We’ll identify hot-spots where sightings are prevalent and explore any correlations between sighting locations and UFO shapes. Seasonal Patterns Analysis - A time series plot can be created to visualize patterns in sightings over different seasons( winter, spring, summer, and fall) and will also investigate the impact of astronomical events on reported sightings.\n\nWeek-3\n\nFinal Analysis and Reporting.- Summarizing key findings from the geographic distribution and seasonal patterns analysis. Discuss any correlations observed. Prepare the visualizations and insights for presentation.\nReview - Review the analysis for accuracy and completeness, making any necessary revisions. Finalize the proposal and preparing for presentation\nOn March 11 the Project will be ready for presentation."
