But at the same time, it is possible that they have seen a UFO and didn’t have the proper methods to report such a sighting.\nOn the other hand, people in larger cities may not be able to clearly view these supposed “UFO sightings” due to air pollution and sky-scrapers being more prevalent in these areas. But contrary to people in smaller cities, they may have the means to report the sightings quickly.\nWe believe that although this would introduce bad data in the data-set, there isn’t a suitable solution to address this issue. But the shapes column in the ufo_sightings data-set can be a good way to filter out the data-sets, regardless of the location of the sightings.\nShapes that are more commonly sighted will be more likely to actually be true, versus shapes that have one-off or just a few sightings.\nFor example, the “cube” shape has only been sighted twice, which is improbable that it may be sighted correctly, because otherwise we would have seen more sightings of that shape in our data-set. On the other hand, the circle shape appears to be very likely as it has been sighted over 9000 times.\nFurthermore, in order to establish a correlation between UFO shapes and locations, we plan to run a chi-squared test that can quantify the strength and significance of these relationships."

All the data that might not be necessary for our workflow will be removed. We will also be adding and modifying data to the datasets that we have received from the TidyTuesday.\nOur first step with tackling the first question is to use the cleaned data to plot a heatmap of the world.\nWe will group the data of the countries to find the number of sightings in each of the countries.\nThen, we will use the ggmap package of R to plot a heatmap of the world with this data.\nFrom there, we will work on zoning in on the United States. Figuring out those cities where these sightings are prevalent. This will be done using ggplot’s geom_point feature, and the longitude and latitude columns. We will paste this plot over a realistic map of the United States, marking the cities where the density of the sightings are more prevalent.\nThen, we will visualize whether certain areas are more likely to report a certain shape. This will be done with a histogram, comparing the densities of the shapes for the states.\n\nQ.2) Are there any patterns to the sightings concerning seasons? Do astronomical events affect the reported sightings?\n\nFirst, we will slice the reported_date_time_utc column in the ufo_sightingsdataset, and separate the dates and times from it.\nThen we will clean data to handle all the various time zones and merge them accurately, which we have explained below.\nAlongside this, we will work on grouping the dates, by their seasons (i.e. spring, summer, fall, winter)\nUsing this data, we will plot a line chart to visualize the time series analysis of the seasonal data.\nFor the plot to visualize whether astronomical events affect the sightings, we are going to be using a sunburst plot, which will be a part of the sunburstR package.\n\nParameters used\n\nufo_sightings\n\nreported_date_time_utc\ncity\nstate\ncountry_code\nshape\n\nplaces\n\nlatitude\nlongitude\npopulation\nelevation\nstate\ntimezone\n\nday_parts_map\n\nAll columns other than rounded_lat and rounded_long"

    "text": "Question-1\nWhat is the geographic distribution of UFO sightings? Are there any hotspots where the number of sightings is prevalent? Is there any correlation between the location of the sighting and the shape of the UFO?\n\nIntroduction\nEmbarking on a quest to uncover the geographic footprint of UFO sightings, we delved into the data to unveil patterns and hotspots of extraterrestrial encounters. Our journey traversed through spatial landscapes, painting a rich tapestry of sightings across regions. Along the way, we sought to discern any correlations between sighting locations and the enigmatic shapes of UFOs, navigating through the mysteries of the cosmos with data as our compass.\n\n\nApproach\n\nHeatmap Distribution of UFO Sightings: The approach begins by aggregating UFO sighting data by country to understand the geographic distribution. This data is then visualized using a heatmap overlay on a world map, with color intensity representing sighting density. By leveraging ggplot and map_data functions, the visualization highlights regions with higher concentrations of sightings, providing a global perspective.\nUFO Sighting Distribution Around the World: For a closer examination, the analysis zooms in on the United States to identify hotspots of UFO activity. Leveraging the leaflet package, latitude and longitude coordinates of sightings are plotted on an interactive map, allowing users to explore sightings in specific locations. This approach offers a detailed view of sighting prevalence across different states.\nVariance of Shape Sightings: To understand the diversity of reported UFO shapes, the approach filters out less common shapes and creates a bar plot to visualize the frequency of each shape. By focusing on shapes with higher sighting counts, this analysis reveals which shapes are most frequently reported by witnesses, offering insights into popular UFO descriptions.\nTime-series Plot by Season: Exploring potential seasonal patterns, the approach categorizes sightings by season and plots the number of sightings over decades. Using emojis to represent seasons adds a human touch to the visualization, making it more engaging. This analysis aims to uncover any recurring patterns or fluctuations in sightings across different seasons over time.\n\n\n#| warning: FALSE\n#| echo: FALSE\n#| output: FALSE\n\n\nworld_map &lt;- map_data(\"world\")\ncolnames(world_map)[5] &lt;- \"country\"\n\n\ncolor_scale_values = c(\"&lt;1\" = \"#D8FAFD\", \n                       \"1-29\" = \"#8FFAFD\", \n                       \"30-59\" = \"#0CFDF3\", \n                       \"60-149\" = \"#3282F6\", \n                       \"150-299\" = \"#0023F5\", \n                       \"300-999\" = \"#00129A\", \n                       \"1000+\" = \"#000C7B\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_polygon(data = world_map, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group), fill = \"white\", color = \"black\") +\n  geom_polygon(data = heatmap_data, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = sighting_count_range), color = \"black\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values =  color_scale_values) +\n  coord_fixed(1.3) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUFO Sighting Distribution Around the World\n\nus_places_data &lt;- places |&gt;\n  select(state, country, country_code, latitude, longitude)\nus_places_data &lt;- us_places_data |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(latitude) & !is.na(longitude))\nus_places_data &lt;- us_places_data |&gt;\n  filter(country_code == \"US\")\n\n\nmap_plot &lt;- leaflet(data = us_places_data) |&gt;\n  addTiles() |&gt;\n  setView(\n    lng = -115,    # Adjusted center longitude for the entire US\n    lat = 37,      # Adjusted center latitude for the entire US\n    zoom = 3       # Adjusted zoom level\n  )\n\n\nmap_plot &lt;- map_plot |&gt;\n  addCircleMarkers(lat = ~latitude, lng = ~longitude, color = \"#51EE00\", stroke = FALSE, fillOpacity = 0.8)\n\nmap_plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariance of Shape Sightings\n\nshapes_filtered &lt;- ufo_sightings |&gt;\n  select(city, state, country_code, shape) |&gt;\n  filter(shape != \"other\" & shape != \"unknown\")\n\n\nshapes_filtered &lt;- shapes_filtered |&gt;\n  group_by(shape) |&gt;\n  filter(dplyr::n() &gt;

Do astronomical events affect the reported sightings?\n\nintroduction\nOn a Journey Through the Seasons of UFO Sightings:\nLet’s delve into the mysteries surrounding UFO encounters and their connection to the ever-changing seasons. Imagine walking through a visual landscape that captures the essence of each season, from the warmth of summer to the chill of winter, all while uncovering patterns in reported sightings. As we navigate through the data, we’ll explore whether astronomical events play a role in shaping these enigmatic encounters, inviting you to ponder the cosmic dance between the unknown and the familiar.\n\n\nApproach\n1 Preparing the Data: Just like setting up our gear before an expedition, we’ll clean and organize our data to ensure it’s in top shape for analysis.\n2 Seasonal Explorations: Imagine we’re stargazers, observing the night sky throughout the year. We’ll group sightings by season to see if there are any patterns or trends in when UFOs appear.\n3 Astronomical Insights: Like astronomers tracking the movements of celestial bodies, we’ll investigate if events like dusk, dawn, or twilight coincide with reported UFO sightings.\n4 Visualizing the Journey: Using our artistic flair, we’ll craft captivating visualizations that paint a vivid picture of UFO encounters across seasons and celestial events.\n\n\ncode\n\n# Ufo sightings by part of the day (Naitik)\n\nsetDT(ufo_sightings)\ndf &lt;- ufo_sightings[, .(sightings = .N), day_part]\nView(df)\n\ndf &lt;- na.omit(df)\n\ndf$day_part &lt;- gsub(\"night\",\"Night\",df$day_part)\ndf$day_part &lt;- gsub(\"nautical dusk\",\"Nautical Dusk\",df$day_part)\ndf$day_part &lt;- gsub(\"afternoon\",\"Afternoon\",df$day_part)\ndf$day_part &lt;- gsub(\"morning\",\"Morning\",df$day_part)\ndf$day_part &lt;- gsub(\"astronomical dusk\",\"Astronomical Dusk\",df$day_part)\ndf$day_part &lt;- gsub(\"civil dusk\",\"Civil Dusk\",df$day_part)\ndf$day_part &lt;- gsub(\"civil dawn\",\"Civil Dawn\",df$day_part)\ndf$day_part &lt;- gsub(\"nautical dawn\",\"Nautical Dawn\",df$day_part)\ndf$day_part &lt;- gsub(\"astronomical dawn\",\"Astronomical Dawn\",df$day_part)\n\n\nggplot(df, aes(x=reorder(day_part, sightings), y=sightings, fill=day_part)) +\n  geom_bar(stat=\"identity\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(title=\"UFO Sightings by Part of the Day\",\n       x=\"Part of the Day\",\n       y=\"Number of Sightings\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position=\"none\",\n    panel.grid.major = element_blank(), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis:\n\nInitiating Data Preparation:\n\nTo ensure our expedition yielded meaningful insights, we commenced by meticulously preparing the data, laying a solid foundation for our analysis.\nThrough careful cleaning and organization, we readied the dataset for the adventure ahead, ensuring accuracy and reliability in our findings.\n\nUnveiling Seasonal Insights:\n\nLike seasoned investigators, we delved into the data to unravel the mysteries of seasonal patterns in UFO sightings.\nOur exploration led us to uncover fascinating correlations between the changing seasons and the frequency of reported encounters, shedding light on nature’s influence on these phenomena.\n\nExploring Astronomical Associations:\n\nWith a keen eye on the celestial realm, we ventured into the realm of astronomical events to understand their potential impact on reported UFO sightings.\nThrough rigorous analysis, we sought to discern whether phenomena such as dusk, dawn, or twilight played a role in shaping the occurrence of these mysterious encounters."
