The location (latitude and longitude), the time and date of the sighting, the shape of the purported UFO, the duration of the sighting, and any other comments or descriptions provided by witnesses are typically included in this dataset.\nThere are 3 CSV files in the dataset:\n\nufo_sightings.csv: It has 12 variables such as city, state, country_code, and shape. In total 96,429 rows.\nplaces.csv: It has 10 variables such as longitude, latitude and time zone, country_code, and alternate_city_names. There are 14,417 rows.\nday_parts_map.csv: It has 12 variables such as sunrise, sunset, civil_twilight_end, nautical_twilight_end, and astronomical_twilight_end. It’s of 26,409 rows.\n\nMake sure to load the data and use inline code for some of this information.\nWhy did you choose this dataset?\nThere are several reasons why we chose this dataset. The first reason is that the data is well-formatted and is rich in variables, making it interesting for data wrangling and visualizing patterns. The second reason is the social media engagement and interest in this particular phenomenon. We will determine whether the Naruto Run to Area 51 was worth the time and resources. Lastly, UFO sightings hold a plethora of significance in scientific research, as humans have been wondering and searching for life outside Earth ever since the first telescope was discovered. In summary, it would be interesting to engage in discussions of mysteries of the cosmos and extraterrestrial life while also contributing to the cause with our visualizations."
