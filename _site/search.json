The first reason is that the data is well-formatted and is rich in variables, making it interesting for data wrangling and visualizing patterns. The second reason is the social media engagement and interest in this particular phenomenon. We will determine whether the Naruto Run to Area 51 was worth the time and resources. Lastly, UFO sightings hold a plethora of significance in scientific research, as humans have been wondering and searching for life outside Earth ever since the first telescope was discovered. In summary, it would be interesting to engage in discussions of mysteries of the cosmos and extraterrestrial life while also contributing to the cause with our visualizations."

Is there any correlation between the location of the sighting and the shape of the UFO?\n\nOur plan for tackling this question involves using the ufo_sightings.csv and the places.csv.\nThe data will be then visualized, and the geographical locations of the sightings will be plotted on a map using the ggplot2 package.\nThe hotspots where the sightings are prevalent can also be visualized using the dataset.\nThen a stacked bar chart can be plotted to show the correlation between the location of the sightings and the shape of the UFO.\n\nAre there any patterns to the sightings concerning seasons? Do astronomical events affect the reported sightings?\n\nTo solve this question, we will use the ufo_sightings.csv and the day_parts_map.csv datasets.\nThen, using the data given in the dataset, we will group the sightings based on seasons of the year (i.e. winter, spring, summer, and fall)\nFrom there, we can create a time series analysis plot to visualize if there are any patterns in the sightings concerning the season.\nFrom the day_parts_map.csv dataset we can also visualize if there is any correlation between astronomical events (such as twilight, sunrise, sunset, etc.) and UFO sightings"
