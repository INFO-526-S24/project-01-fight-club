The location (latitude and longitude), the time and date of the sighting, the shape of the purported UFO, the duration of the sighting, and any other comments or descriptions provided by witnesses are typically included in this dataset.\n\nThere are 3 CSV files in the dataset:\n\n-   `ufo_sightings.csv`: It has 12 variables such as city, state, country_code, and shape. In total 96,429 rows.\n\n-   `places.csv`: It has 10 variables such as longitude, latitude and time zone, country_code, and alternate_city_names. There are 14,417 rows.\n\n-   `day_parts_map.csv`: It has 12 variables such as sunrise, sunset, civil_twilight_end, nautical_twilight_end, and astronomical_twilight_end. It’s of 26,409 rows.\n\n## Dataset\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Get the Data\n# Reading the data manually\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\nufo_sightings <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2023/2023-06-20/ufo_sightings.csv')\nplaces <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2023/2023-06-20/places.csv')\nday_parts_map <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2023/2023-06-20/day_parts_map.csv')\n\nhead(day_parts_map)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 6 × 12\n  rounded_lat rounded_long rounded_date astronomical_twilight_begin\n        <dbl>        <dbl> <date>       <time>                     \n1          40          -80 2022-08-28   09:07:43                   \n2          40          -90 2022-08-21   09:38:33                   \n3          40          -80 2022-08-14   08:48:54                   \n4          40          -90 2022-08-07   09:19:00                   \n5          30         -120 2022-08-07   11:55:02                   \n6          40         -100 2022-07-24   09:39:05                   \n# ℹ 8 more variables: nautical_twilight_begin <time>,\n#   civil_twilight_begin <time>, sunrise <time>, solar_noon <time>,\n#   sunset <time>, civil_twilight_end <time>, nautical_twilight_end <time>,\n#   astronomical_twilight_end <time>\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhead(places)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 6 × 10\n  city        alternate_city_names state country country_code latitude longitude\n  <chr>       <chr>                <chr> <chr>   <chr>           <dbl>     <dbl>\n1 Pinehurst   Pajnkherst,bynhwrst… NC    USA     US               35.2     -79.5\n2 Rapid City  <NA>                 MI    USA     US               44.8     -85.3\n3 Cleveland   CLE,Cleaveland,Clev… OH    USA     US               41.5     -81.7\n4 Bloomington BMG,Bloomington,Blu… IN    USA     US               39.2     -86.5\n5 Irvine      rvajn,Ervajn,Irvajn… CA    USA     US               33.7    -118. \n6 Moore       Mur,mu er,mua,mueo,… OK    USA     US               35.3     -97.5\n# ℹ 3 more variables: timezone <chr>, population <dbl>, elevation_m <dbl>\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhead(ufo_sightings)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 6 × 12\n  reported_date_time  reported_date_time_utc posted_date city        state\n  <dttm>              <dttm>                 <date>      <chr>       <chr>\n1 2022-08-29 06:03:00 2022-08-29 06:03:00    2022-09-09  Pinehurst   NC   \n2 2022-08-20 01:51:00 2022-08-20 01:51:00    2022-10-08  Rapid City  MI   \n3 2022-08-13 05:30:00 2022-08-13 05:30:00    2022-09-09  Cleveland   OH   \n4 2022-08-06 21:00:00 2022-08-06 21:00:00    2022-09-09  Bloomington IN   \n5 2022-08-04 07:40:00 2022-08-04 07:40:00    2022-09-09  Irvine      CA   \n6 2022-07-22 16:00:00 2022-07-22 16:00:00    2022-09-09  Moore       OK   \n# ℹ 7 more variables: country_code <chr>, shape <chr>, reported_duration <chr>,\n#   duration_seconds <dbl>, summary <chr>, has_images <lgl>, day_part <chr>\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Why did you choose this dataset?**\n\nThere are several reasons why we chose this dataset. The first reason is that the data is well-formatted and is rich in variables, making it interesting for data wrangling and visualizing patterns. The second reason is the social media engagement and interest in this particular phenomenon. We will determine whether the Naruto Run to Area 51 was worth the time and resources. Lastly, UFO sightings hold a plethora of significance in scientific research, as humans have been wondering and searching for life outside Earth ever since the first telescope was discovered. In summary, it would be interesting to engage in discussions of mysteries of the cosmos and extraterrestrial life while also contributing to the cause with our visualizations.\n\n## Questions\n\nQ.1) What is the geographic distribution of UFO sightings? Are there any hotspots where the number of sightings is prevalent? Is there any correlation between the location of the sighting and the shape of the UFO?\n\nQ.2) Are there any patterns to the sightings concerning seasons? Do astronomical events affect the reported sightings?\n\n## Analysis plan\n\n**What is the geographic distribution of UFO sightings? Are there any hotspots where the number of sightings is prevalent? Is there any correlation between the location of the sighting and the shape of the UFO?**\n\n-   Our plan for tackling this question involves using the `ufo_sightings.csv` and the `places.csv`.\n-   The data will be then visualized, and the geographical locations of the sightings will be plotted on a map using the `ggplot2` package.\n-   The hotspots where the sightings are prevalent can also be visualized using the dataset.\n-   Then a stacked bar chart can be plotted to show the correlation between the location of the sightings and the shape of the UFO.\n\n*Parameters used*\n\n-   `ufo_sightings`\n    -   `reported_date_time_utc`\n    -   `city`\n    -   `state`\n    -   `country_code`\n    -   `shape`\n-   `places`\n    -   `latitude`\n    -   `longitude`\n    -   `population`\n    -   `elevation`\n\n**Are there any patterns to the sightings concerning seasons? Do astronomical events affect the reported sightings?**\n\n-   To solve this question, we will use the `ufo_sightings.csv` and the `day_parts_map.csv` datasets.\n\n-   Then, using the data given in the dataset, we will group the sightings based on seasons of the year (i.e. winter, spring, summer, and fall)\n\n-   From there, we can create a time series analysis plot to visualize if there are any patterns in the sightings concerning the season.\n\n-   From the `day_parts_map.csv` dataset we can also visualize if there is any correlation between astronomical events (such as twilight, sunrise, sunset, etc.) and UFO sightings\n\n*Parameters used*\n\n-   `ufo_sightings`\n    -   `reported_date_time_utc`\n    -   `day_part`\n    -   `country_code`\n",
